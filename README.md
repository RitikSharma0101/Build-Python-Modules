# ðŸ§± Build Python Modules

This repository contains beginner-friendly custom Python modules created to explore how modules work and how to build reusable code components in Python.

Each file demonstrates a concept like modular design, reusable functions, or logic separation. Great for learning how to break code into manageable parts.

## ðŸ“‚ Modules Included

### 1. ðŸŽ° Random Number Generator (LCG)
- Implements a basic pseudo-random number generator using Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
- Fully custom â€” no `random` module used
- Accepts a range (`low`, `high`) and returns a number in that range
- Includes custom seeding logic
- [View Code](./random-number-generator/random_number.py)

*(More modules coming soon...)*

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This project is designed to:
- Practice writing and using Python modules from scratch
- Learn about code reusability and separation of concerns
- Reinforce understanding of function scope, seeding, and randomness

Ideal for Python beginners and self-learners who want to improve their modular coding skills.
